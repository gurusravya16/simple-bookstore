# simple-bookstore
This is a small online bookstore built with React (for the website) and Node.js with Express (for the server). It uses SQLite to store book info and orders.  You can browse books, add or remove them from your cart, and then checkout. When you checkout, your order is saved in the database with the book details and quantity.
